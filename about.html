<!-- <p>I've been fascinated with the low-carb lifestyle for almost 2 years now. After completing my chef qualification and working in the industry, I was a bit disillusioned with the realities of the chef lifestyle. I felt my passion for food fading and decided to go study law -->

<p>This is a ketogenic lifestyle blog.<br/>
  All the recipes were either created or modified (from non-ketogenic recipes) by me.</p>

<p>My name is Ann√©s and I qualified as a chef and pastry chef in 2012 but you can call me Nessie. A very special nickname given to me by my late mother.
  This blog is dedicated to her. To her endless support and belief that I would one day find my passion in life.<br/>
  In 2016 after gaining 35kg I started struggling with various health issues. Things like walking a few steps left me breathless,
  I had pain and inflammation in my joints, I was always tired and my doctor warned me that I was pre-diabetic.<br/>
  Drastic changes had to be made. I explored various diets and tested them all out but the ketogenic lifestyle is the one that stuck and made me feel incredible. I've been following it ever since.<p/>

<p>I've always dreamed about working online. A dream I thought was silly because I'm a chef but I recently discoverd that I could turn my love for developing and photographing recipes into a career.<br/>Please follow me on my journey as I navigate this new chapter as an amateur food photographer.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me for any collaborations</p>
