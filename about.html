<!-- <p>I've been fascinated with the low-carb lifestyle for almost 2 years now. After completing my chef qualification and working in the industry, I was a bit disillusioned with the realities of the chef lifestyle. I felt my passion for food fading and decided to go study law -->

<p>My name is Ann√©s but you can call me Nessie. A very special nickname given to me by my late mother.
  This blog is dedicated to her. To her endless support and belief that I would one day find my passion in life.<br/>
  I qualified as a chef and pastry chef in 2012. Although I loved working in the kitchen, my dream has always been to work online so that I could pursue my other passion: travelling the world.<br/>
  A dream I thought was silly because I'm a chef and how can a chef work online?<br/>
<br/>
  One good thing that came out of this pandemic is that it forced me to re-evaluate my career options and that is when I discoverd that I could turn my love for developing and photographing recipes into a career.<br/>
  Please follow me on my journey as I navigate this new chapter as an amateur food photographer.<br/>
<br/>
  Why did I choose the ketogenic lifestyle as my main focus?<br/>
  I've been following a ketogenic lifestyle since 2016. After leaving home studying and working took its toll on me and I started making very unhealthy choices.
  I gained 35kg in a very short period of time, things like walking a few steps left me breathless and my doctor warned me that I was pre-diabetic.<br/>
  Drastic changes had to be made. I explored various diets and tested them all out but the ketogenic lifestyle is the one that stuck and made me feel incredible. It's only once I cut carbs that I discoverd
  my body doesn't digest them very well. Symptoms such as constant headaches and fatigue, bloating and other intestinal issues (issues I actually started struggling with in my teens but never even considered to be diet related) vanished.<p/>

<p>Now I share my passion for this lifetsyle through my blog. All the recipes were either created or modified (from non-ketogenic recipes) by me.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me for any collaborations</p>
