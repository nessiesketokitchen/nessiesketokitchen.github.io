<!-- <p>I've been fascinated with the low-carb lifestyle for almost 2 years now. After completing my chef qualification and working in the industry, I was a bit disillusioned with the realities of the chef lifestyle. I felt my passion for food fading and decided to go study law -->

<p>My name is Ann√©s but you can call me Nessie. A very special nickname given to me by my late mother.
  This blog is dedicated to her. To her endless support and belief that I would one day find my passion in life.<br/>
  I qualified as a chef and pastry chef in 2012. Although I loved working in the kitchen, my dream has always been to work online so that I could pursue my other passion: travelling the world.
  A dream I thought was silly because I'm a chef and how thus a chef work online?
  One good thing that came out of this pandemic is that it forced me re-evaluate my career option and that's when I discoverd that I could turn my love for developing and photographing recipes into a career.<br/>
  Please follow me on my journey as I navigate this new chapter as an amateur food photographer.<br/>
<br/>
  I've been following a ketogenic lifestyle since 2016. After leaving home, studying and working took it's toll on me and I made very unhealthy choices.
  I gained 35kg in a very short period of time. I started struggling with various health issues. Things like walking a few steps left me breathless,
  I had pain and inflammation in my joints, I was always tired and my doctor warned me that I was pre-diabetic.<br/>
  Drastic changes had to be made. I explored various diets and tested them all out but the ketogenic lifestyle is the one that stuck and made me feel incredible. It's only once I cut carbs that I discoverd
  my body doesn't digest them very well. I went from feeling bloated and swollen all the time, stomach cramps, headaches and fatigue to feeling the best I've ever felt.
  I grew up with a lot of these symptoms and back then, not knowing how important diet was I never thought it could be the food I was consuming that caused these problems.<p/>

<p>This is a ketogenic lifestyle blog.<br/> All the recipes were either created or modified (from non-ketogenic recipes) by me.</p>
