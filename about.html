<!-- <p>I've been fascinated with the low-carb lifestyle for almost 2 years now. After completing my chef qualification and working in the industry, I was a bit disillusioned with the realities of the chef lifestyle. I felt my passion for food fading and decided to go study law -->

<p>This is a low-carb lifestyle blog.</p>
<p>The aim of this blog is to share recipes that I've either created or modified to be low-carb friendly, tips, meal ideas and to support people in maintaining a low-carb lifestyle.</p>

<p>I am a qualified chef and I have a lot of low-carb knowledge, I have been following this lifestyle for about 2 years.</p>
<p>I work as a private chef and I run a low carb kitchen in Stellenbosch through which you can order meals, for more information check out the Facebook link below.</p>
