<!-- <p>I've been fascinated with the low-carb lifestyle for almost 2 years now. After completing my chef qualification and working in the industry, I was a bit disillusioned with the realities of the chef lifestyle. I felt my passion for food fading and decided to go study law -->

<p>This is a ketogenic lifestyle blog.</p>
<p>You'll find my recipes here. All the recipes were either created or modified (from non-ketogenic recipes) by me.</p>

I'm endlessly passionate about the ketogenic lifestyle and love sharing recipes.</p>
<p>My name is Ann√©s, nickname Nessie. A very special nickname given to me by my late mother. This blog is dedicated to her endless support and belief that I would find my passion in life.<br/> I'm qualified as a chef and pastry chef in 2012. 4-5 years ago I started having health issues. I'd gained a large amount of weight, walking became a chore and I was bordering on diabetes. The ketogenic lifestyle saved my life and I've been following it ever since.
<p>I've recently discoverd a new love for developing and photographing recipes.<br/>Please follow me on my journey as I navigate this new chapter as an amateur food photographer.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me for any collaborations</p>
