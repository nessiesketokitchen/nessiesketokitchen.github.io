<!-- <p>I've been fascinated with the low-carb lifestyle for almost 2 years now. After completing my chef qualification and working in the industry, I was a bit disillusioned with the realities of the chef lifestyle. I felt my passion for food fading and decided to go study law -->

<p>This is a ketogenic lifestyle blog.</p>
<p>You'll find my recipes here. All the recipes were either created or modified (from non-ketogenic recipes) by me.</p>

<p>I qualified as chef and pastry chef in 2012. I have a lot of knowledge and insight to share about the ketogenic lifestyle as it is a lifestyle that I've been following for the last 3-4 years.
I'm endlessly passionate about the ketogenic lifestyle and love sharing recipes. This lifestyle saved me from a terribly unhealty path I was going down.</p>
<p>I've recently discoverd a new love for developing and photographing recipes.</p>
<p>Please follow me on mu journey as I navigate this new chapter as an amateur food photographer.</p>
<p>Feel free to conact me for any collaborations</p>
