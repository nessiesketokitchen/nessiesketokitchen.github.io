<p>
Last week I spoke about the changes that take place inside your body when you start eating low carb.
This week I want to focus on the benefits that follow once these changes happen.
The key phrase here is <span style="font-style:italic">stable blood sugar levels</span> and that is something that is not only beneficial to diabetics but to us all.
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<span class="bold">You will have more energy</span><br/>
Fats will be your new source of energy and if you did not read last week's post, not all fats are bad for you. Fats do not have the same effect on our blood sugar levels as carbohydrates so our bodies aren't eager to use and store it as quickly as it does with carbohydrates.
This means that your body will have more fuel for longer because you won't have spikes in your blood sugar levels.
When your blood sugar levels become spiked, insulin is released to help store that energy as fat instead of using it.
</li>

<li>
<span class="bold">You will stay full for longer</span><br/>
When your blood sugar levels stabilise, the production of hormones such as ghrelin (stimulates hunger) and leptin (reduces hunger) become balanced. 
By incorporating healthy fats into your meals your body will have all the energy it needs.
</li>

<li>
<span class="bold">Insulin levels will drop</span><br/>
Insulin is only produced to help the body use and store glucose. Glucose is only produced when our bodies digest carbohydrates. 
This means when you are on a low carbohydrate diet, your body won't need to produce as much insulin.
If your body is constantly producing insulin to use and store glucose, you are overworking your pancreas and that can eventually lead to insulin resistance and utimately type 2 diabetes.
Which means your body can't stabilise your blood sugar levels anymore which in turn can lead to large amounts of weight gain and other health problems associated with diabetes.
</li>

<li>
<span class="bold">An increase in healthy cholesterol (HDL) and decrease in bad cholesterol (LDL)</span><br/>
New studies have proved that diets that are low-fat and high carb are more harmful to our cholesterol levels than low carb and high fat diets.
An increase in HDL and a decrease in LDL means a lower risk of heart disease.
You can find more information on this by reading a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297472">2006 study</a> done by Eric C Westman and others in the International Journal of Cardiology.
</li>

<li>
<span class="bold">Weight loss</span><br/>
Once you you stop eating high carbohydrate foods, you'll have less glucose in your system and that meas less insulin production which means your body isn't storing fat anymore.
Instead, your body will be using the fat it has as enery and you will lose weight.
</li>

<li>
<span class="bold">Lowers triglycerides</span><br/>
Our body stores fat in the form of triglycerides. There is an obvious correlation here: when our bodies stop storing fat, our triglycerides levels drop.
This is important because triglycerides have been linked to heart disease and strokes.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
To end off I'd like to say that there will always be an argument for both sides but take the time to consider what you are putting into your body and ask yourself what is better for you. 
The aim of this lifestyle is to eat wholesome foods in their natural state.
High carb and low-fat foods have all been modified and processed in some way, these foods are not natural.
