<p>
Many people have concerns when it comes to eating low carb. They may wonder whether or not they will have enough energy, whether or not they will have to eat more or snack more in order to stay full, whether or not they can still exercise on a reduced carb intake, etc.
People also worry that it will be expensive to live a low carb lifestyle, which is a very common misconception.
Firstly, when you switch from eating a high amount of carbohydrates to less than 20g of carbohydrates a day (which is the amount of carbs you should stay under if you're doing low carb) your body will go through some changes.
It might be difficult at first and all those questions I spoke about above might start popping into your mind. Rome wasn't built in a day and nothing that requires a massive change comes easy.

<h2 class="section-heading">Glucose and the body</h2>

<p>
A common condition that can occur once you cut the carbs is carb flu, although it is important to note that not everyone gets it. Carb flu will make you feel tired and weak, it will give you headaches, it may make you feel extra hungry or give you an intense craving for carbs. It will make you question whether or not you've made the right decision. Carb flu may last anything from 3-5 days and it will pass, don't let it get the better of you. A high carbohydrate diet makes your body produce a lot of glucose because carbs become glucose when digested. This means that your body is using glucose for fuel and since our bodies can only use a small amount of glucose at a time, the rest is stored as fat. The idea behind eating low carb is to lower your glucose levels so that your body can use your fat for fuel instead of storing it.
</p>

<p>
So when you start cutting out high carbohydrate foods, your body will need to adjust and use up all the glucose before it switches to using fat for fuel. Your body needs time to adjust and this is why you might get carb flu. You need to give your body the time to switch over so when you start feeling ill just stick through it. It will be worth it and when it is over you will feel the best you have ever felt. At this stage you might feel like you're not getting enough energy from your low carb diet but don't worry about it, this feeling is only temporary. Once your body is using fat for fuel, you will have enough energy (maybe even more than you're used to). When your body uses fat for fuel, it is called being 'in ketosis' and that is what you should strive for.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why do we want lower glucose levels?</h2>

<p>
Glucose causes blood sugar levels to spike and drop in very short amounts of time. This causes the body to produce insulin. Insulin helps the body use the glucose and helps to keep blood sugar levels down. That is why a low carbohydrate diet is unbelievably beneficial to people whose bodies can't produce enough insulin. If your body can't produce insulin, your blood sugar levels sky rocket when you eat high carbohydrate foods and instead of using the glucose for energy, it is immediately stored as fat. Lower glucose levels mean that your body will use its fat instead of storing it and stable blood sugar levels.

<h2 class="section-heading">Low carb and hunger</h2>

<p>
A low carb diet means eating less than 20-30g net carbs a day (you work out net carbs by subtracting the fiber content from the carb content). Once you start living on this amount of carbs a day your blood sugar levels will stabilize, as mentioned above. Once your body starts using fat for fuel you won't need those extra calories or extra carbs anymore and believe me it will come naturally, you won't feel like your forcing yourself to eat less or eat less high carbohydrate foods. Most of us are used to eating more than we need to, we are used to snacking and eating when we are not hungry just because it has become routine or because we are bored. We don't want you to starve yourself though so you'll have to learn to distinguish between real hunger, eating because you're bored and eating out of habit. The general rule of thumb is to only eat when your hungry. Since I started eating low carb, I only eat once or twice a day and I don't snack. I only eat when I'm hungry and I never feel like I'm starving myself.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Fat is your friend</h2>

<p>
Most low carb diets include eating higher amounts of fat because fat is what will fill you up and keep you full. Like I said in my previous blog post, fat is your friend. Studies from earlier years have led us to believe that all fats are unhealthy but that is incorrect. There are unhealthy fats, any fat that is chemically made or modified or hydrogenated are unhealthy for you because they don't occur naturally but are man-made.  Naturally occurring fats are healthy and good for you. Our ancestors ate all kinds of fats that occur naturally and they did not have the same heart and health problems we have today. We have been led to believe fats are the culprits for many diseases while sugar and carbs are to blame. If you want to know if the fat you eat is healthy, ask yourself whether or not it occurs naturally. This should be a rule for all foods though, we need to eat more natural and wholesome foods and cut out anything that contains a list of chemicals. It is important to note that you should still limit your fat intake because fat contains higher amounts of calories and even though you are eating low carb, it is still important to control your calorie intake.

<h2 class="section-heading">The bottom line</h2>

<p>
Bottom line is that when your blood sugar levels are stabilized and your body is used to having 20-30g of carbs a day and you incorporate a good amount of fats into your diet, you will have all the energy you need, you will feel amazing, you will be able to continue exercising and you will lose weight. I can testify to this. There are other things also happening inside your body but that will be the topic of next week's blog.

<p>
I really hope that all of you will consider doing some more research after reading this. We have been fooled for many years by companies paying for studies saying low fat and high carbohydrate diets are better for our health. There are also many low carb support groups on Facebook with thousands of people who can testify to the amazing benefits of a low carb lifestyle. Remember there are many sceptics out there who will try to bring you down and tell you otherwise but always do what is best for you and never let other people tell you what to do. At the end of the day, you need to decide what works for you and stick to it. On that note, this week I am sharing my <a target="_blank" href="/recipes/2018/04/11/balsamic-cheese-sauce.html">Balsamic Cheese Sauce</a>. It is one of my favourite original recipes. It's the perfect addition to any meal because it is not only delicious but it's an awesome way to add some fat to your meal.

<p>Happy low carbing!</p>
