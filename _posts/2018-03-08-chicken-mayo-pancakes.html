These are tasty and easy to make because everything you need can be prepared in advance.
It is also a great idea to make these if you have left over chicken from a previous lunch or dinner.
The best way to stay on track is to make your meals delicious and comforting and to ensure that you don't feel like you're missing out.
Feeling like you're missing out on other food is and will always be the main reason you cheat.

This recipe is delicious, comforting and satisfying and that is why I chose it for my first meal idea.
This will be the first in a series of delicious meal suggestions.
Whenever I feel like jumping off the wagon and indulging in my "Achilles heel" (which for me is Chinese take-out), this meal really saves me from cheating.
After a chicken-mayo pancake I always feel happy and glad I chose this lifestyle.
It gives me hope that I can do it.
Most people won't understand that feeling of hope but those out there that love eating or anyone who has an unhealthy or addictive relationship with food will understand how important it is to have hope that you can overcome it.

<ul>
  <li>Whole chicken/chicken pieces/chicken fillet</li>
  <li>200-300ml <a target="_blank" href="/recipes/2018/03/08/mayonnaise.html">mayonnaise</a>
    <br/>(depends on how creamy you want it, I like my chicken with extra mayo)</li>

  <div class="panel-body">
    If you don't have time to make your mayonnaise or your cream cheese, look out for brands that don't contain sugar or cereal fillers.
    When I'm buying, my favourite low-carb mayonnaise brand is Martinnaise.

<h2 class="section-heading">Recipe</h2>

<ol>
<li>Pre-heat the oven to 180&deg;C.</li>
<li>In a bowl mix the garlic, onion, herbs, lemon juice and oil to create a wet rub.</li>
<li>Coat the chicken in the rub.</li>
<li>Roast the chicken in the oven, the time will depend on how much and what chicken you used (if using fillets, cover them with foil because they dry out much quicker than the other pieces). It will take anything from<br/> 20 minutes - 1 hour, it will be ready as soon as clear juices run from the chicken.</li>
<li>While you wait for the chicken, chop the chives and sundried tomatoes, make the mayonnaise (if you opt for homemade) and make the pancakes.</li>
<li>Let it cool down and then flake the chicken (pull the meat off the bones) or cut up the fillets.</li>
<li>Mix the chicken with the mayonnaise, chives and sundried tomatoes and season to taste.</li>
<li>Assemble the pancakes by filling each with the chicken-mayo mix and rolling them up.</li>
</ol>

<p>They taste great hot or cold. Enjoy!</p>
