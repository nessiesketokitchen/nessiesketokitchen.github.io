  I love sweet potatoes and they are the best substitute for anything potato related.
The thing is, their calorie and carb counts are just as high as those of the potato.
BUT, and luckily for us sweet potatoes are a low-gi food whereas potatoes aren't.
Low-gi means that it is digested, absorbed and metabolised slower.
This makes sweet potatoes better and healthier to eat.

I would definitely recommend using them as a substitute for potatoes, but also remember to eat them in moderation since they are still high in carbs and calories.
It is also important to remember that for every potato dish there is a lower calorie, lower carb alternative other than sweet potato.
I only recommend using sweet potato when you have a craving for potato that no other food will satisfy.
I would recommend not eating sweet potato more than twice a week but it would be even better if you only use sweet potato on special occasions.

<p>Here are a few things I use sweet potato for and keep in mind this is on occasion:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Potato salad - an old "braai classic".</li>
  <li>Potato on the fire - it is the perfect alternative and tastes even better. Just wrap with foil and put it on the coals. Serve with lots of butter.</li>
  <li>Fries - an awesome alternative if you're craving although I actually prefer these to potato fries.</li>
  <li>Mash - this mash is the closest alternative to potato mash if that is what you are craving but keep in mind that using pumpkin or cauliflower to make mash is much lower in carbs and calories.</li>
  <li>Potato bake - sweet potato is naturally sweeter and in my opinion makes a more delicious bake, just add lots of butter and cream.</li>
</ol>
