<p>
So this week I would like to take the time to introduce my business.
I run a small kitchen in Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Arfrica that serves homecooked meals, all 100% sugar and carb free.
I trade under the name Low Carb Kitchen Stellies and you can find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/{{ site.facebook_username }}">Facebook</a>.
I wanted to start this business because I know how difficult it can be to always eat healthy, especially when you don't have time to cook.
</p>

<p>
I'll be making and serving low carb meals that are super easy to transport, simple to heat and quick to freeze and store.
Like I said in my first blog post: preparation and convenience is key to staying on track and in this world everything that is easy and convenient is generally unhealthy. That's where I come in.
The idea behind combining my business and my blog is to create a support network. I can only do so much and what each and every person chooses to eat on their own time (when not having one of my meals) is their own responsibility.
I hope to give everyone buying my food and reading my blog the correct tools to maintain the low carb lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
The low carb lifestyle is very beneficial for so many reasons besides the obvious weight loss benefits.
Look out for next week's blog post where I will be discussing the benefits of eating low carb, setting the record straight about consuming fat and busting the myths surrounding sugar and carbohydrates.
On that note, check out this week's recipe for <a target="_blank" href="/recipes/2018/04/04/creamy-mash.html">Creamy Cauliflower Mash</a> to get started on cutting down carbs.
You can make this as a side to almost anything, so it's easy to add into your weekly meals.

<h2 class="section-heading">Some things to consider</h2>

<p>
This week I want to leave you with a few things to consider:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Eating low carb does not open the door to over-eating just because you aren't consuming heavy and dense carbohyrates. You still need to check the amount of calories you eat to ensure you aren't over-eating.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fats are your friends, they are what will help you stay full but also keep in mind this doesn't mean an all-you-can-eat buffet of fats since not all fats are healthy.
    Healthy fats are foods such as nuts, avocados, butter, cream, coconut oil, and cheese.
    Unhealthy fats are all fats that do not occur naturally or that have been modified such as margarine, and hydrogenated oils such as canola and sunflower.
    The key to distinguish what is good and bad is that anything unnatural and modified is not wholesome or good for your health.
  </li>
  <li>
    You don't have to eat 5-6 times a day, your body has enough fuel to sustain itself. Eating constantly does not benefit your metabolism and once you start cutting out carbs you will see that you aren't hungry all the time.
    Carbs are one of the main culprits of hunger pains. They make you feel full right after you eat but that is temporary because they spike blood sugar levels, causing them to fall shortly after, which means that you will become hungry much quicker than when following a low carb diet.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your body is used to running on carbs and you cut them out, it might take a few days for your body to get used to it. You might feel tired or ill but that is okay, just stick with it, don't be fooled into thinking you need carbs.
    Your body is fixing itself and using up all the glucose that was stored from eating carbs. Once that is done, your body will start using your fat stores for fuel and you will feel amazing, trust me. I have more energy eating low carb than I have ever had before.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck on your new journey and happy eating.</p>
