<p>Are you an oats for breakfast fan? A warm, buttery hug in a bowl fan? Have you been missing it? Well look no further.
  My Pumpkin Porridge is the perfect replacement. The nuttiness of the almond flour inspires the same flavour profile as oats.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
      I cook my own pumpkin puree, four cups puree is equal to 1kg of raw pumpkin.<br/>
      The cooking method depends on whether I was able to get a whole pumpkin or pre-cut pumpkin.<br/>
      Oven: cut the wole pumpkin into quarters, salt and drizzle with oil and roast on 180Â°C until soft.<br/>
      Stove-top: add the pre-cut pumpkin with a some butter into a large pot, steam for 10 minutes and then leave it uncovered until soft (this ensure all the moisture cooks out).<br/>
      Pumpkin contains a lot of water therefore you don't need to add water to steam it.<br/>
