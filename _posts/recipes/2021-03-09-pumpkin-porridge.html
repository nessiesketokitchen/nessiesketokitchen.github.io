<p>Are you an oats for breakfast fan? A warm, buttery hug in a bowl fan? Have you been missing it? Well look no further.
  My Pumpkin Porridge is the perfect replacement. The nuttiness of the almond flour inspires the same flavour profile as oats.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      I cook my own pumpkin puree, four cups puree is equal to 1kg of raw pumpkin.<br/>
      I cook my pumpkin in a bit of butter and salt, nothing more.<br/>
      My preferred cooking method is steaming it for 10 minutes and then
      leaving it uncovered until soft (this ensure all the moisture cooks out).<br/>
      Pumpkin contains a lot of water therefore you don't need to add water to steam it.<br/>
      Add as much erythritol and butter as you like, the amounts in the recipe are to my liking.
