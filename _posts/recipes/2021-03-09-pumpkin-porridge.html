<p>Are you an oats for breakfast fan? A warm, buttery hug in a bowl fan? Have you been missing it? Well look no futher.
  My Pumkin Porridge is the perfect replacement. The nuttiness of the almond flour inspires the same flavour profile as oats.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
      I cook my own pumpkin puree, four cups puree is equal to 1kg of pumpkin.<br/>
      I cook my pumpkin in a bit of butter and salt, nothing more.<br/>
      My preferred method for cooking pumpkin is steaming it for 10 minutes and then
      leaving it uncovered until soft to cook out all the moisture.<br/>
      Pumpkin has a lot natural moisture, you don't need to add water to steam.<br/>
      Add as much erythritol and butter as you want, the amounts in the recipe are to my liking.
