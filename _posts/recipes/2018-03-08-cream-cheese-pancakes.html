<p>These pancakes are seriously tasty, you won't be missing regular old pancakes anymore!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

<p>Yield: 2-4 pancakes (depends on how thick the batter is poured in to the pan)</p>

<ul>
<li>55g <a target="_blank" href="/recipes/2018/03/08/cream-cheese.html">cream cheese</a></li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tsp sugar substitute or 1/2 tsp salt (depeding if you want to make sweet or savoury)</li>
<li>any other flavouring (garlic powder, onion powder, cinnamon, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<ol>
<li>Mix the eggs and cream cheese, use a spoon to flatten the cream cheese and a whisk to mix. You can use an electric mixer but be careful not to over mix and make the batter frothy (it will result in pancakes with too many bubbles and they will fall apart).</li>
<li>Pour the batter into a hot pan (use a little oil or butter in the pan to stop the pancake from sticking).</li>
<li>Once the pancake starts making a few bubbles in the middle, you can flip it over. These pancakes don't have any binding agent such as gluten and therefore they can be tricky to work with. It might take a few tries to get it right without breaking them, but you'll soon get into the rhythm.</li>
</ol>
