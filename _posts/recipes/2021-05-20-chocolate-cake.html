        CAKE:<br/>
        The quantity of the cake recipe is equal to one cake layer, multiple by the amount of layers you want for your cake.<br/>
        Do not let the cake batter stand for longer than 5 minutes (The batter becomes very thick and difficult to work with). If you don't have enough cake tins to bake at the same time rather make a new batch for each bake.
        This is a very thick batter due to the addition of the whey powder.<br/>
        Adding boiling water to the cocoa powder is called blooming, it helps release the flavour for a more intense cocoa flavour.<br/>
        CHOCOLATE MOUSSE:<br/>
        This mousse recipe is a little more involved but I promise you won't regret using a custard base.<br/>
        Make the mousse the day before to save time. Remove it 30 minutes before decorating from the fridge.<br/>
        CHOCOLATE GANACHE:<br/>
        Do not let the ganache harden (do not add to fridge) completely before spreading it over the cake layers.
