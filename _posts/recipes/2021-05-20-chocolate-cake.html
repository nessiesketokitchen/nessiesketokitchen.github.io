<p>This is one my proudest recipes. This low carb and sugar-free cake is absolute heaven. The texture is soft, moist and light.
  You'll never need another cake recipe, I'd state my reputation on it.</p>

    <div class="panel-body">
        CAKE:<br/>
        The quantity of the cake recipe is equal to one cake layer, multiply by the amount of layers you want for your cake.<br/>
        Do not let the cake batter stand for longer than 5 minutes (The batter becomes very thick and difficult to work with). If you don't have enough cake tins to bake at the same time rather make a new batch for each bake.<br/>
        This is a very thick batter due to the addition of the whey powder.<br/>
        The addition of boiling water to the cocoa powder is called BLOOMING, it helps release the flavour for a more intense cocoa flavour.<br/>
        <br/>
        CHOCOLATE MOUSSE:<br/>
        This mousse recipe is a little more involved but I promise you won't regret using a custard base.<br/>
        Make the mousse the day before to save time.<br/>
        Remove it 30 minutes before decorating from the fridge.<br/>
        <br/>
        CHOCOLATE GANACHE:<br/>
        Do not let the ganache harden completely (i.e., don't put it in the fridge) before spreading it over the cake layers.
