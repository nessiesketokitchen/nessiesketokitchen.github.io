<p>I grew up eating a lot of baked beans but with all the added sugar in commercially produced beans, it's something I had to give up.
Legumes are a great source of fiber but the problem lies with all the sugar found in the sauce so I set out to recreate one of my favourite childhood meals.</p>
<p>
Prep time: 5 minutes<br/>
Cook time: 17 minutes<br/>
Serving: equal to 1 store bought can of beans<br/>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>


<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup stock</li>
    <li>1 tbsp erythritol</li>
    <li>3 drops liquid smoke</li>
    <li>pinch of salt</li>
    <li>1 can butter beans, drained</li>


</ul>
