<p>I grew up eating and loving of baked beans but with all the added sugar in commercially produced baked beans, it's something I had to give up.
Legumes are a great source of fiber but the problem with baked beans specifically is all the sugar found in the sauce. So I set out to recreate one of my favourite childhood meals.</p>
<p>
Prep time: 5 minutes<br/>
Cook time: 17 minutes<br/>
Serving: equal to 1 store bought can of baked beans<br/>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>


<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar-free tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup stock</li>
    <li>1 tbsp erythritol</li>
    <li>3 drops liquid smoke</li>
    <li>pinch of salt</li>
    <li>1 can butter beans, drained</li>


</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Instructions</h2>

<br/>

<ol>
    <li>In a small pot, combine all the ingredients except the butter beans. Cook on a medium heat until the sauce starts to simmer (1-2 minutes).</li>
    <li>Add the butter beans and cook uncovered for 15 minutes or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat and serve warm or leave to cool down.</li>
</ol>

        I use butter beans because they are equal to 7g net carbs per 100g. Just keep in mind what else you're consuming if you want to stay in ketosis.<br/>
        Beans are a great option for carb cycling. I never cycle above 50g net carbs which means I might not follow a ketogenic plan everyday but I still remain low carb.
