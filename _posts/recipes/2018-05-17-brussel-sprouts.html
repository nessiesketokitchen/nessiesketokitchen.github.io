<p>Presenting brussel sprouts in a new light.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

<p>Yield: enough for 4.</p>

<span class="bold">Brussel Sprouts</span>

<ul>
    <li>1 glove garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>5 rashers bacon cut up or 100g bits of bacon</li>
    <li>2 small leeks</li>
    <li>350g brussel sprouts</li>
</ul>

<span class="bold">Sauce</span>

<ul>
    <li>250ml cream</li>
    <li>80g blue cheese (you can add more or less depending on how strong you want it)</li>
    <li>1 tsp honey or xylitol for lower carbs - this amount of honey shared between four won't do any harm</li>
    <li>1 tbsp pepper</li>
    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp <a target="_blank" href="/recipes/2018/03/08/mayonnaise.html">Mayonnaise</a></li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Chop up the garlic, slice the leeks and cut the brussel sprouts into quarters.</li>
    <li>Fry the garlic in the butter with the pieces of bacon and leave it to crisp up.</li>
    <li>While you wait for the bacon to crisp up, pour the cream (for the sauce) into a separate pot and let it heat up but not boil.</li>
    <li>Once the bacon is crispy add the leeks and brussel sprouts and leave for about 10 minutes, I prefer my vegetables to still be crisp but you can leave it on longer.</li>
    <li>Once the cream is hot, leave it on the stove on a low heat and add the blue cheese piece by piece while stirring until it dissolves.</li>
    <li>Take the cream off the heat and add the honey/xylitol, pepper and salt. Only add the mayonnaise once it has cooled off a bit.</li>
    <li>Pour the sauce over the brussel sprouts or serve on the side.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
