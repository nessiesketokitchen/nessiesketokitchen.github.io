<p>The best thing to have on fries.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>350ml cream</li>
  <li>50-100ml balsamic vinegar (depending on how vinegary you want the sauce - taste as you add)</li>
  <li>1 cup grated cheese</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Recipe</h2>

<br/>

<ol>
  <li>Pour the cream into a pot and let it simmer for 10 minutes in order to reduce the cream.</li>
  <li>Turn the stove to a low heat and slowly add the grated cheese while stirring.</li>
  <li>Alternate the pot off and on the heat when adding the cheese to prevent it from splitting.</li>
  <li>Take the pot off the heat and let cool for 10 minutes, it does not need to be completely cooled but this is vital to prevent the vinegar from splitting the mixture.</li>
  <li>Add the balsamic vinegar and season with salt.</li>
  <li>When using the sauce, heat it up on a low heat wile stirring, do not let it boil otherwise it will split.</li>
</ol>

This recipe was inspired by my partner's love of vinegar with fries.
I serve it with sweet potato fries, it is the perfect comfort food for cold winter days.

<p>Enjoy!</p>
