    <div class="panel-body">
        The cooking time of the Cheesecake will vary from oven to oven. That is why this recipe has such a wide range for the cooking time.<br/>
        The reason I suggest mixing the eggs by hand is because you don't want the mixture to become overly frothy.<br/>
        <span style="font-style:italic">Bain-marie</span>: A water-bath that assists with an even cook throughout the Cheesecake.
