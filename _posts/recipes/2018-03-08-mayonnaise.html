  <div class="panel-body">
    Making a tasty homemade mayo is always tricky, especially when you are only using oils that are healthy for you.
    It can be expensive and it can be tricky to balance the bitterness of the oil.
    Therefore it is best to use multiple oils.
    I prefer avocado oil, macadamia oil but macadamia nut oil can be very expensive when you're on a budget.

<ol>
<li>Combine the garlic paste, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, sugar and yolk in a bowl.</li>
<li>Slowly add a little bit of the oil to the mix while mixing.</li>
<li>Keep adding the oil slowly and only a little bit at a time while mixing (emulsify) until the mix starts to become a thick and creamy mayonnaise. Keep in mind it is best to only add the next bit of oil once the previous bit has fully combined into the mix. You may not need to use all the oil, if you feel the consistency is right you can stop.</li>
<li>Taste the mayonnaise, depending on what oil you used it can have a bit of bitter aftertaste.</li>
<li>Balance it out with more sugar if you feel it needs it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember this recipe uses a fresh egg yolk, keep it in the fridge and discard after 5 days.</p>
