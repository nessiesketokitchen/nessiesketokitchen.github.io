<p>The same great taste without all the guilt.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

<p>Yield: one 24cm cake.</p>

<span class="bold">Base</span>

<ul>
    <li>1 &amp; 1/4 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>80ml xylitol</li>
    <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
</ul>

<span class="bold">Filling</span>

<ul>
    <li>450g full fat cream cheese</li>
    <li>2/3 cup xylitol</li>
    <li>250ml sour cream</li>
    <li>Juice of 1 small lemon</li>
    <li>5 eggs (extra large)</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 160&deg;C and line 24cm cake pan with baking paper and butter (the baking paper helps remove the cake from the tin easier).</li>
    <li>Melt the butter and mix with the 80ml xylitol and almond flour.</li>
    <li>In a bowl mix together the cream cheese, 2/3 cup xylitol, sour cream and lemon juice.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs and mix until completely blended (I prefer to mix by hand because over-mixing it can cause the fat to separate, but if you use an electrical mixer be sure to mix in short bursts and not too much).</li>
    <li>Pour into the cake pan and bake in a <span style="font-style:italic">bain-marie</span> (a cold water bath that surrounds the cake for even baking) for approximately 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li>Keep an eye on it and test it every 15 minutes after the first hour until ready. You want the cake to be stiff all around but still slightly wobbly in the middle to get that ultra smooth texture.</li>
</ol>

        Replace the almond flour with coconut flour and replace the cream cheese with marscapone.

<p>
Xylitol adds moisture and that is why you have to test and keep an eye on it because the baking time will vary from oven to oven.
Also, you don't have to use the specific size cake pan but that will also change the baking time, just always keep an eye on it.

<p>Enjoy!</p>
