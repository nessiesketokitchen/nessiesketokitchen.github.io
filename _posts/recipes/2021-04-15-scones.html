    <div class="panel-body">
        Serve with jam, cheese and cream for a more traditional scone.<br/>
        Other serving ideas include: lemon curd, custard or syrup.<br/>
        These scones are so tasty, I mostly enjoy having them with just butter.<br/>
        Remember to adjust the baking time if you change the size of the scones.<br/>
        The blackberry base in the frozen-yoghurt pops recipe is how I make my jams. Follow the recipe until step three.
