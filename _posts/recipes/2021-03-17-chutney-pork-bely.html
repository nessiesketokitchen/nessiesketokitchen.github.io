<p>I love pork belly. It is one of my go-to proteins to cook. What I love most about pork belly is the versatility. Leftover pork belly can be turned into so many other delicious meals, making meal prep for the week just that much easier.</p>

Prep time: 15 minutes<br/>

    <li>Thinly slice the onion and add it to a hot pan. Leave it on a high heat for 3 minutes then turn down to a low heat.</li>
    <li>Add the erythritol and leave the onions to caramelise, until golden brown (5-8 minutes).</li>
    <li>Crush the garlic and slice the cherry tomatoes in half.</li>
    <li>Combine everything except the pork belly and add to a slow-cooker.</li>
    <li>Add the pork belly on top and set the slow-cooker to high.</li>
    <li>Leave the pork belly to cook for 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C and set to grill.</li>
    <li>Score the pork skin and finish it off in the oven, to crisp it up (30-60 minutes).</li>
    <li>Add it to the oven with the cooking liquid. It will evaporate and turn into a sticky chutney.</li>
</ol>

        <h3 class="panel-title">Tip</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        If you don't have a slow-cooker, cook the pork belly (covered) in the oven on 160°C for +- 3hours.<br/>
        You can use any type of tomato, tinned even. I prefer fresh cherry tomatoes for their natural sweetness.<br/>
        Make the pork belly ahead of time and leave it in the fridge overnight before crisping it up in the oven.
        This way you can easily remove the excess fat when it hardens.<br/>
        If you choose to leave it overnight, first heat up the pork belly before setting the oven to grill.<br/>
        I prefer using a lower grill temperature to ensure an even crisp.<br/>
        You can serve the pork belly as a roast or pull the meat. Use the left over meat on pizza, in tacos, wraps, omelettes or in pasta.
