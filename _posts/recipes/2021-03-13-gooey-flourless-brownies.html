    <div class="panel-body">
      These brownies don't contain any raw egg or flour so don't worry about under baking them.<br/>
      The brownies will rise really high in the oven and then colapse because there are no eggs to form a structure but this adds to the gooeyness.<br/>
      Handle the brownies with care. They are more delicate than normal brownies because they don't contain eggs or flour. I suggest moving them with a spatula.
