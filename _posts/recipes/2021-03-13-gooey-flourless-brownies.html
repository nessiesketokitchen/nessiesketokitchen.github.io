    <div class="panel-body">
      These brownies don't contain any raw egg or flour so don't worry about under baking them.<br/>
      Adding boiling water to the cocoa powder first, activates it and gives a richer chocolate taste: it's called blooming<br/>
      The brownies will rise really high in the oven and then collapse when removed. This is because there are no eggs to form a structure but this is also what makes them super gooey.<br/>
      Handle the brownies with care, they are more delicate than standard brownies because they don't contain eggs or flour.
