<p>I don't often cook or eat soup but this recipe changed all of that. I always double up the batch because I honestly can't get enough.
The key to creating this moreish soup is to source good quality stock and smoked pork.</p>

<p>
Prep time: 10 minutes<br/>
Cook time: 35 minutes<br/>
Serving: +-4x 400ml servings<br/>

    <div class="panel-body">
      Serve with thick buttered low carb bread or bread of choice.<br/>
      Reheat the soup on a low heat to avoid the cream splitting.<br/>
      When making a big batch do not add cream if you plan on freezing the soup, add the cream when reheating.<br/>
      Add more stock if you don't like your soup as thick.
