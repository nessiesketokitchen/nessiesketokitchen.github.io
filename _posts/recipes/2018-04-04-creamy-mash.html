<ol>
  <li>Chop the garlic and onions roughly or finely chop if you don't have a blender.</li>
  <li>Add 25ml of the butter to a hot pan (reserve the rest for later).</li>
  <li>Fry the garlic first for a minute and then add the onions and fry till soft on a medium heat. Season with salt.</li>
  <li>While the onions are frying chop up the cauliflower (the smaller the cauliflower is chopped the quicker it wil cook).</li>
  <li>Add the cauliflower and fry on a high heat till it burns slightly (this adds a nice charred flavour but it is optional). Season with salt.</li>
  <li>Add the stock and the cream, cover and let simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Open the lid and let it reduce till it is thick and creamy.</li>
  <li>Take off the heat and add the remaining butter.</li>
  <li>Blend or mash by hand and serve.</li>
  <li>Taste and add seasoning as needed or more cream and butter if you want it to be creamier.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
