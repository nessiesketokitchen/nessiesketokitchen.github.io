        The baking paper makes it easier to remove the bars from the tray.<br/>
        Store the bars in an airtight container in the fridge.<br/>
        The coconut oil serves as a binder for the bars.<br/>
        I don't make my own granola because I don't eat it often enough, the granola used is low-carb and from a local company.
