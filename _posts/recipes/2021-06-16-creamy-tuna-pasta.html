<p>This creamy, rich and velvety smooth bowl of pasta isn't only quick and easy to make but the ingredients are already in
  most of our kitchens. Like most of my recipes, I was inspired by something I regularly ate growing up called tuna mate.</p>

<p>
Prep time: 10 minutes<br/>
Cook time: 25 minutes<br/>
Serving: 2-4 servings<br/>

    <div class="panel-body">
        I use a low-carb pasta made from seed and nut flours but this recipe is just as good served with vegetable noodles.<br/>
        The sauce becomes very thick after you mix in the cheese but only add extra liquid
        after you've added the tuna if it's still too thick (it's impossible to drain all the liquid from the tuna so it will help even out the sauce).<br/>
        The serving suggestion is 2-4 because of the richness of the meal, some people might prefer a smaller portion.
