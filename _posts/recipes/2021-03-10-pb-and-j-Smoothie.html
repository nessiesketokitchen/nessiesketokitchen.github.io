<p>This recipe was a happy coincident. My gut was in need of some TLC but I was also craving something sweet and tasty, the rest is history.
This drinkable PB&J is delicious, creamy and full of fiber, probiotics and good fats.

    <div class="panel-body">
        I used a sugar-free Maple syrup for this recipe (made by a local company).<br/>
        Any ful fat/double cream yoghurt will do if you don't have kefir available.<br/>
        Substitute almond, coconut or macadamia nut milk for a dairy-free alternative.
