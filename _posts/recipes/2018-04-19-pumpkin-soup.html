<p>The perfect hearty meal for winter.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

<p>Yield: +- 2l soup.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1 onion</li>
  <li>1kg pumpkin</li>
  <li>2.5 tbsp mother-in-law curry powder</li>
  <li>2.5 tbsp cumin</li>
  <li>2.5 tbsp ground ginger</li>
  <li>2 tbsp xylitol</li>
  <li>2 tbsp honey<br/>(this is optional as honey raises the carb count but this recipe makes at least 8 servings of which the carb count for 1 serving is low)</li>
  <li>3 ripe pears</li>
  <li>500ml stock of choice<br/>(I use chicken -  it adds more flavour than vegetable stock)</li>
  <li>salt - remember to season the layers</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C.</li>
  <li>Chop the garlic, onion and pumpkin.</li>
  <li>Fry the chopped garlic and onion in 1 tbsp butter till lightly browned and season.</li>
  <li>Add the second tbsp of butter and the chopped pumpkin.</li>
  <li>Add 2 tbsp curry spice, 2 tbsp cumin, 2 tbsp ginger and the xylitol and season again.</li>
  <li>Leave it to cook off on a low/medium heat (pumpkin contains a lot of water, you want it to evaporate but not burn so keep an eye on it).</li>
  <li>Peel and cut up the pears.</li>
  <li>Put the pears on a lined baking tray and add the remaing spices and honey and put it in the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Once the pumpkin is sticky and not wet anymore, add the pears, the stock and season.</li>
  <li>Let simmer for 10 minutes to combine all the flavours.</li>
  <li>Blend and serve.</li>
</ol>
