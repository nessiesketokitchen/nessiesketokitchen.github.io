<p>Did someone say grilled cheese?</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>

<p>Yield: 2-4 slices of bread (depends on how big the slices are shaped).</p>

<ul>
    <li>600g cauliflower (cut up into chunks - the smaller, the quicker it will cook and the easier it will be to drain the water)</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>100g cheese (any you prefer - I like half cheddar, half parmesan but parmesan can be expensive so it's optional)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp psyllium husk</li>
    <li>1/4 tbsp dried italian mix herbs</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C.</li>
    <li>Cook the cauliflower until soft - do not add water since cauliflower already has a lot of water in it.</li>
    <li>Let the cauliflower cool down and then transfer it to a cloth. Use the cloth to squeeze out all the water.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cauliflower to a bowl and mix in the rest of the ingredients.</li>
    <li>On a baking tray lined with baking paper, shape the mix into bread slices.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 10 minutes or till golden brown (every oven is differnt, you'll have to keep an eye on it).</li>
</ol>
