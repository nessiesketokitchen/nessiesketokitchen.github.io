    <div class="panel-body">
        If you don't want a big cardamom kick, add only <span>&frac12;</span> tsp cardamom.<br/>
        Have the eggs whisked and ready to go before you combine the dry and wet ingredients to make the folding process easier. Whey powder is
        essential in creating a cake like texture but it becomes sticky when combined with wet ingredients.<br/>
        After 25 mintues, test the doneness of the cake by inserting a knife or skewer. If it comes out clean it's ready but if it's still wet leave the cake and test in
        increments of 5 minutes. The cake starts to cook very quickly towards the end.<br/>
        Use this <a href="/recipes/2021/04/06/plum-sauce.html">Plum sauce</a> recipe to serve with the cake. Omit the soy sauce and add 1 tsp vanilla extract.
