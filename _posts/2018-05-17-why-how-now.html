I know it's been a while since I've posted anything - my business <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/{{ site.facebook_username }}">Low Carb Kitchen Stellies</a> has been keeping me extremely busy.
So this week I'll be sharing my journey that led to the creation of my business with you.
Back in 2015/2016 I lost 20 kilograms through maintaining a low-carb lifesyle but over the course of about 2 years I slowly gained half of that back. 
Some of it (although very little but which was the catalyst for more weight gain) was due to travelling overseas. 
As a chef I am always curious and excited to eat foreign cuisine and experience foreign culture, so that weight gain was inevitable but it led to a "I'll start eating low-carb again next week" kind of attitude which led to even more weight gain.
Then life got busy as it does with many of us and heavy amounts of takeaways led to even more weight gain.
</p>

<p>
This made me realise three things:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Whenever you cheat, you should never adopt the attitude of "whatever, I'll have one more and start again later".
It's always easy to make excuses and do something later, but you'll never get into the low-carb lifestyle if you keep resisting it.
</li>

<li>
You should allow yourself some space to cheat (that is if you're like me).
I'm a chef and food is my life. I'm always om the lookout for new restaurants (especially culturally authentic ones). I enjoy dining at places that do set courses and a big  part of how I plan my travels involves food. 
Although you can just pick the item on the menu that is low-carb friendly or ask for it without the carbs, there are some places you go to because they do something special and I always want to eat it the way the chef intended.
</li>

<li>
I needed a place where I could get low-carb convenience meals. Making low-carb meals every day can be challenging if you don't have the right ingredients ready.
It's easy to just fall back to whatever is most convenient. Having pre-made meals prepared makes this a lot easier.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
That was when I decided to start my own business. The idea was daunting and after months of consideration and going back and forth with ideas on how to go about creating a business that sells low-carb meals, <span style="font-style:italic">Low Carb Kitchen Stellies</span> was born.
This has not only been helpful to my customers but also to me. It has been easier to maintain my own low-carb lifestyle since making <span style="font-style:italic">Low Carb Kitchen Stellies</span> my life.
So now I've started my journey again and I hope to lose the weight I've gained and reach my goal weight. 
I am not only doing this to look good, I am doing this to claim my health as my own. 
I want to know that as I grow older I don't have to worry about the many pains and diseases that come with being overweight and living an unhealthy lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I want to add that with point 2 above, I do not advocate cheating often. I am merely saying that we all find ourselves in situations where we want to have that burger or we want to eat the Vietnamese spring rolls (that an old lady in Vietnam learned from her great-grandmother to make) or to have that slice of cake with loved ones on their birthday.
You cannot stop living your life just because of your diet but always keep in mind that you should not over-do it. Have your treat and then continue with your lifestyle.
Don't be like me and just keep giving in because you had one cheat.
I take my mistakes as life lessons and I feel like I can move forward now without fail.
I am happy and excited about the future and I love this new adventure I've taken on, sharing the low-carb lifestyle with others and making their journey easier brings me so much pleasure.

I'll try my best to keep blogging at least once every two weeks but for now my business comes first.
