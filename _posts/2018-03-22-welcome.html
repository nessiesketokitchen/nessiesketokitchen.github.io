<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>This is a low carb lifestyle blog and through it I want to share my experiences and help other people achieve their goals.
It can be difficult to make a lifestyle change especially in this rat race we call life.
Fast food and quick fixes are all over the place and it is not always easy to stay on track.
That is what I am here for, to make your life a little easier.</p>

<p>I don't want to just share my recipes with you, I also share tips and hacks to help make this easier.
Low carb has so many unbelievable benefits besides weight loss.
As a chef I love to cook and bake, I love to eat and I love to eat all things unhealthy.
It isn't always easy to resist and even the best of us fall off the wagon sometimes. It has happened to me so many times and it still does.
So put away all your fears and remember things don't change overnight.
This is a journey and I'll be here with you every step of the way.</p>

<p>Firsty, it is important to get yourself into the right headspace, you cannot attempt to change your eating habits if you're not ready to make the commitment.
I do not encourage cheating but sometimes when you're really craving something non-low carb it is best to give in and have that treat.
Sometimes the only way to stay on track is to give yourself a little leeway.
This doesn't give you the freedom to go overboard and willingly jump off the wagon and eat it too.</p>

<p>When you do decide to have a cheat meal try to limit it to one meal/food item a week, I find it is best to reserve it for when you eat out or get take-out.
Some of you will be able to do this cheat free and some of you won't. Don't beat yourself up, no-one is perfect.
I fall to the temptation to cheat every now and again, and let's face it some things just can't be replaced by a low-carb alternative (although you will be surprised to see that 90% of the things you crave, will have a delicious guilt-free substitute!)
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Tips to get started</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to get started, some I'm sure you already know:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get rid of anything tempting in your cupboards. If you live with someone who will not be eating low-carb, ask them to keep their treats hidden away.</li>
  <li>Always be prepared and make food in advance for days when you are tired or too busy to cook. I always have some frozen meals that are easy to heat.</li>
  <li>If you are somewhere where you don't have control over what food is being served, try eating the foods with the lowest carbs. For example, if there is an option between ribs coated in a basting (which will definitely contain sugar) or a sandwhich, opt for the ribs (gluten is our number one enemy!)</li>
  <li>If you are eating out always ask for no sauce or no basting unless they can assure you that it does not contain wheat or sugar. When you eat out don't feel embarassed to take your own sauce or dressing with you. You should never care about what people think.</li>
  <li>If you have an extreme craving for something, have it but have it in moderation. I've tried to withhold cravings before and then I just end up cheating for a whole week.</li>
  <li>If you cheat, don't beat yourself up. Pick yourself up, forget about it and move forward. Holding on to things will hold you back.</li>
  <li>Take it one step at a time, try cutting out one thing at a time.</li>
  <li>Take up a hobby or keep yourself busy when those carb-thoughts come rushing in.</li>
  <li>Most important of all, don't stop living your life. If you're not ready, don't force yourself. This lifestyle change should not feel like a burden.</li>
</ol>

<p>Through my blog posts I'll be sharing ideas on how to use my recipes and I'll also give time-friendly and bugdet-friendly tips.</p>

<p>Happy eating and good luck!</p>
