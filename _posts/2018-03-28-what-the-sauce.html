Sauce is on almost everything and it is difficult to avoid especially when ordering in or dining out.
The sauce on something like ribs, wings or salad dressings, pizza bases, etc. may not seem like a big deal but you'd be suprised to know how many sugars are hidden in it.
Even creamy sauces have hidden sugars because they use wheat and maze to thicken the sauce in restaurants.

Remember sugar isn't just sugar as we know it, all carbs are high in sugar so those thickeners used in sauces also add more sugar.
When carbohydrates are digested by our bodies it gets turned into glucose, which is a type of sugar.
So it's a good rule of thumb to avoid all sauces and bastings that contain sugar or are thickened with wheat, maze or cereal.
If you go out for dinner or order in you can ask to have your meal without the basting (when ordering something like ribs or steak) and when ordering a salad, ask for it with balsamic vinegar or olive oil.

It is super easy to replicate your favourite sauce and there are so many healty sugar alternatives that you can use like xylitol, stevia and erythritol that are all low calorie, low-gi and 100% safe to consume.
These sugars to do not act the same as cane sugar or sugar carbs, they do not become glucose and therefore do not spike your blood sugar.
Over the next few weeks I'll be sharing a few of my favourite sauce recipes.

<h2 class="section-heading">Sauce ideas</h2>

<p>
I love this <a target="_blank" href="/recipes/2018/03/28/bbq-sauce.html">BBQ sauce</a>. It tastes great and is very versatile. I use it on so many dishes.
Here are just a few ideas on how to use this sauce:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Basting for meats (think braaied/grilled meats, wings, ribs)</li>
  <li>Sauce for meatballs</li>
  <li>Burger sauce (bunless ofcourse)</li>
  <li>Sauce for sweet potato fries (like a replacement tomato sauce)</li>
  <li>Meatloaf (do not add oats or lentils to your meatloaf, all a meatloaf needs is eggs, meat and sauce)</li>
  <li>You can use the sauce in wraps (carb free wraps of course)</li>
  <li>You can use it as a salad dressing (it goes well with steak and chicken salads)</li>
  <li>It is also a fantastic sauce for pizza (carb free base)</li>
</ol>
